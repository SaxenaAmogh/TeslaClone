Hi!
This is a project I have done using HTML and CSS. 
I have built a clone of Tesla website. As I am in early stages of learning Javascript, I haven't implemented it in this project and hence lesser responsiveness and animations. But nonetheless I have completed this in order to not stop practicing.
Looking forward to further improve my code and development.
