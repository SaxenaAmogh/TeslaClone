This project aims to replicate the Tesla website using HTML and CSS. It serves as the first project in frontend development, focusing on design and layout without the use of JavaScript. While the functionality may differ, the visual appearance and structure will closely resemble the original Tesla website.


Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the content of the website.

CSS: For styling and layout, including responsiveness for various screen sizes.

No JavaScript: Due to being in the early learning stages, JavaScript was not used, focusing instead on foundational frontend skills.


Challenges Faced:

Layout Design: Creating a layout that closely resembles the original Tesla website using only HTML and CSS.

Limited Functionality: Working within the constraints of not using JavaScript to implement interactive features and dynamic content.


Future Improvements:

JavaScript Integration: As skills improve, integrating JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic content to the website.

Enhanced Styling: Refining the CSS to improve the visual appeal and user experience.

Accessibility: Implementing accessibility features to make the website usable for all users, including those with disabilities.

Responsiveness: Ensuring the website is responsive and looks good on devices with different screen sizes.

Conclusion:
This project serves as a foundational exercise in frontend development, focusing on HTML and CSS skills. While limited in functionality compared to the original Tesla website, it provides a solid starting point for my future projects and learning in web development.
